#  Coding Quiz Challenge!

[My Coding Quiz](https://nuclearreid.github.io/Coding-Quiz/)

The goal of this project was to create a basic quiz with questions about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code

The quiz will record the user's name/score and display it on a score page. The user can also clear the previous names/scores. All the names and scores are stored locally

When the user selects the correct answer to the question their correct counter goes up by one. If they select the wrong answer, the timer decreases by 10 seconds.

At any time the user can go to the score screen

The designe is very simple and easy to use. I asked my coworker to help me try and break it or find a bug but we couldn't find one. Not to say there arn't any, we just couldn't find one

I used Microsoft Co-Pilot/GPT-4 a lot for helping me with debugging, syntax errors, and other generall questions.

Tom and Prateek also gave me assistance in getting my Score screen and local storage to work.

Lastly, my first commit had a lot of code included in it becasue I did most the coding at work and was unable to push to github over the work wifi
